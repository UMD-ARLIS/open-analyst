# Open Analyst

Open Analyst is a project-oriented research workspace with:

- a React Router 7 web app in `app/`
- server-side API routes in the same React Router app
- a separate Python Strands agent service in `services/strands-agent/`
- Postgres persistence via Drizzle

## Runtime Overview

At runtime the system looks like this:

1. The browser loads the React Router app.
2. UI components call same-origin `/api/*` routes.
3. API routes read and write project data in Postgres.
4. Chat routes proxy model/tool execution to the Strands agent service.
5. The agent calls back into the Node app for project retrieval and source capture.

Chat responses are streamed back as structured progress events plus the final answer. Tool calls, status updates, and the final assistant text are stored on the task so the UI can resume live task state cleanly.

See:

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/REPOSITORY_MAP.md`

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm
- Python with `uv` for the Strands agent
- PostgreSQL
- LiteLLM gateway access

## Environment

Copy these files and fill in the required values:

- `.env.example` -> `.env`
- `services/strands-agent/.env.example` -> `services/strands-agent/.env`

Required variables:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `LITELLM_API_KEY`

Optional variables:

- `LITELLM_BASE_URL`
- `STRANDS_URL`
- `NODE_API_BASE_URL`
- `ARTIFACT_STORAGE_BACKEND`
- `ARTIFACT_LOCAL_DIR`
- `ARTIFACT_S3_BUCKET`
- `ARTIFACT_S3_REGION`
- `ARTIFACT_S3_PREFIX`
- `ARTIFACT_S3_ENDPOINT`

## Local Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
cd services/strands-agent && uv sync
```

Start Postgres:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Run the web app:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Run the Strands agent in a second terminal:

```bash
pnpm dev:agent
```

Run both from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm dev:all
```

The web app serves the UI and API routes on port `5173` by default. The Strands service defaults to `8080`.

## Production-Like Run

Build and serve the web app:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

`pnpm start` only serves the React Router build. The Strands agent is still a separate process and must be started independently, for example with `pnpm dev:agent` or a process manager that points `STRANDS_URL` at the running agent service.

## Database

Generate migrations:

```bash
pnpm db:generate
```

Apply migrations:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```

Open Drizzle Studio:

```bash
pnpm db:studio
```

## Tests and Build

```bash
pnpm test -- --run
pnpm test:agent
pnpm run build
```

## Core Product Model

- A `project` is the top-level unit.
- A project contains `collections` and `documents`.
- A project also contains `tasks`.
- A task contains `messages` and `task_events`.
- Chat can use project knowledge through the RAG endpoint.

## Important Paths

- `app/routes.ts`: route tree for UI pages and `/api/*` resources
- `app/components/`: primary UI components
- `app/lib/db/`: Drizzle schema and query layer
- `app/lib/agent/`: Node-side agent provider abstraction
- `services/strands-agent/src/`: Python agent entrypoint and tool implementations
- `drizzle/`: generated SQL migrations
- `docs/`: current architecture and repository documentation
