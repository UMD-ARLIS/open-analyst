## What is implemented
- Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint mounted at `/mcp`, suitable for MCP-aware clients and gateways.
- API-key protection for MCP traffic with `Authorization: Bearer` or `x-api-key`.
- Multi-source provider adapters for arXiv, OpenAlex, and Semantic Scholar.
- Date-aware search responses that include the current local research date.
- A `collect_articles` workflow that searches first, then selectively stores only matched article files.
- Download pipeline that stores papers by provider/source id and indexes extracted text for RAG.
- Knowledge-graph abstraction with Neo4j support and an in-memory fallback for development/tests.
- Recommendation flow based on graph topics and citation-weighted candidate scoring.
- First-class MCP workflows for daily scan summaries and structured literature reviews.
- Daily sync that refreshes arXiv `src`/`pdf` manifests and recent arXiv/OpenAlex metadata windows.
- Tar selective extraction helper for arXiv bulk archives.
- Server-neutral paper and artifact APIs under `/api/papers/*` for external clients and UI backends.

## Quick start
1. Prefer setting `ANALYST_MCP_*` values in the repo-root `.env`.
2. Optionally create `services/analyst-mcp/.env` only for service-local overrides.
3. If `ANALYST_MCP_POSTGRES_DSN` is omitted, the service falls back to `DATABASE_URL`.
4. When sharing a database with Open Analyst, this service creates and uses its own `analyst_mcp` schema automatically.
5. Start the service from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm dev:analyst-mcp
```

6. Check the MCP/API server:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl -H "x-api-key: $ANALYST_MCP_API_KEY" http://localhost:8000/api/health/details
curl -H "x-api-key: $ANALYST_MCP_API_KEY" http://localhost:8000/api/capabilities
```

7. Start the full stack from the repo root when testing with Open Analyst:

```bash
pnpm dev:all
```

8. In Open Analyst, enable the `Analyst MCP` connector and confirm it points at `http://localhost:8000/mcp` with the same `x-api-key` value.

## Recommended Operating Mode

This repo is now optimized for:

- selective article and PDF storage
- full arXiv manifest awareness
- daily recent metadata sync from arXiv and OpenAlex
- on-demand arXiv bulk extraction for specific identifiers

If that is your target, use:

- [Operations Guide](docs/operations.md)
- [AWS EC2 Manifest Runbook](docs/aws_ec2_manifest_runbook.md)

## Local commands
Install locally:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

Run the server:

```bash
analyst-mcp serve
```

Run one sync pass:

```bash
analyst-mcp sync --sources arxiv,openalex
```

Search and selectively collect matching articles:

```bash
analyst-mcp collect-articles "autonomous UAS OR embodied AI" --sources arxiv,openalex --date-from 2025-03-07 --limit 25
```

Run a daily scan summary:

```bash
analyst-mcp daily-scan "autonomous UAS" --sources arxiv,openalex --lookback-days 2 --limit 10
```

Run a literature review:

```bash
analyst-mcp literature-review "embodied AI for UAS" --sources arxiv,openalex --limit 10 --collect
```

Estimate bootstrap capacity:

```bash
analyst-mcp capacity-estimate 500000000000 64
```

Bootstrap OpenAlex works from the public snapshot:

```bash
analyst-mcp bootstrap-openalex --max-files 2
```

Index arXiv archive manifests and fetch specific source members:

```bash
analyst-mcp bootstrap-arxiv --kind src --max-archives 10
analyst-mcp fetch-arxiv-members 2401.01234 2401.05678 --kind src
```

Selective collection workflow:

```bash
analyst-mcp collect-articles "autonomous UAS OR embodied AI" --sources arxiv,openalex --date-from 2025-03-07 --limit 25
```

Run tests:

```bash
pytest
```

## Server APIs
- `GET /api/papers`
- `GET /api/papers/{canonical_id}`
- `GET /api/papers/{canonical_id}/artifacts`
- `GET /api/papers/{canonical_id}/artifact`
- `POST /api/papers/{canonical_id}/download`

## MCP resources
- `time://today`
- `paper://{canonical_id}`
- `graph://paper/{canonical_id}`

## Provider notes
- arXiv: the implementation enforces a conservative `1 request / 3 seconds` limiter and is designed to prefer bulk/OAI-style workflows for large syncs.
- OpenAlex: requests include the contact email and stay inside common-pool assumptions.
- Semantic Scholar: requests use an API key when provided and keep a conservative per-second default until the deployment tier is known.

## Selective Storage Workflow
1. Use `search_literature` or `collect_articles` with a date window.
2. Let the service persist only normalized metadata for search hits.
3. Download PDFs/source files only for the selected hits.
4. Use `rag_query` over the stored local corpus.

Example:

```text
Give me all articles related to autonomous UAS or embodied AI in the last year.
```

For MCP clients, the corresponding tool call is:

```json
{
  "query": "autonomous UAS OR embodied AI",
  "sources": ["arxiv", "openalex"],
  "date_from": "2025-03-07",
  "limit": 25,
  "preferred_formats": ["pdf"]
}
```

## Current limitations
- The vector retrieval path uses Postgres/pgvector when `ANALYST_MCP_POSTGRES_DSN` is configured and falls back to local JSONL in no-database test/dev mode.
- The OpenAlex bulk ingester currently targets `works`, which is enough to build paper, author, topic, and citation edges but does not yet import the separate author/source/institution snapshots as first-class entities.
- arXiv bulk support currently indexes the official archive manifests and extracts targeted members from tar files; it does not yet maintain a fully normalized historical metadata mirror.
- OCR is intentionally deferred; born-digital PDFs and text artifacts are the supported inputs in this version.
- The standalone UI backend currently keeps chat history in the browser session; persistent multi-session chat storage is not implemented.

## AWS Notes

For AWS EC2 deployment inside your VPC:

- keep `5432`, `6379`, `9000`, and `9001` private
- expose `8000` only to trusted clients
- expose `7474` and `7687` only to your admin IP if needed
- configure AWS credentials so arXiv requester-pays S3 manifest access works
